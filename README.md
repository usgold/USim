# USim
Acoustic field simulator in fourier domain

=========================

## Overview
--------
The toolbox allows simulating the ultrasound wave propagation in non-homogeneous media containing finite size scatterers similar to those existing in a real tissues. The approach of calculations conducted in Fourier space increases the efficiency and allows taking into account the absorption and density phenomena in a simple and correct way. The forward simulations of the wave field are based on the Born-Neumann single scattering approximation of the solution of Sturm-Liouville equation.
